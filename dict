ZERO-DAY: A vulnerability unpatched by the software publishers (or) an unknown vulnerability.

FINGERPRINTING: Fingerprinting a Web App involves gathering info about the web app such as the scripting lang used, server software & version, along with the OS of the server.

DNS ZONE TRANSFER: The DNS zone transfer is the mechanism that uses the AXFR protocol to replicate DNS records across DNS servers. To avoid the need to edit the info on multiple servers, you can edit info on 1 server & use AXFR to copy info to other servers. If you don't protect your servers, malicious parties may use AXFR to get info about all your hosts. Actually DNS is a critical service. If a DNS server for a zone is down & cached info is expired, the domain is inaccessible to all services. Therefore, each zone should have atleast 2 DNS servers. For more critical zones, there may be even more.

THREAT: A possible exploit to a vulnerable system. A threat is a person or event that has the potential of impacting a valuable resource in a -ve manner. In a bank robbery the thief can be considered as the thrat. In network sec the threats remain present but mitigated through the proper use of sec features & procedures.

VULNERABILITY: A weakness in the system that has a possibility for exploitation. It's the quality of a resource or its environment that allows the threat to be realized. In a bank robbery, the bank's employee(bank teller) can be considered as the vulnerability.

PAYLOAD:  In computing, a payload is the carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit. The term has its roots in the military and is often associated with the capacity of executable malicious code to do damage. The term payload has two meanings: data payload, which is related to the transport of data across a network, and malware payload, which refers to malicious code used to exploit and compromise IT networks and systems. DATA PAYLOAD: The payload of a specific network packet or other protocol data unit (PDU) is the transmitted data sent by communicating endpoints; network protocols also specify the maximum length allowed for packet payloads. The payload is then wrapped in a packet that contains information such as media access control address and IP information, quality of service tags, time-to-live data and checksums. MALWARE PAYLOAD: Payload in the context of malware refers to malicious code that causes harm to the targeted victim. Malware payloads can be distributed by methods such as worms and phishing emails. Today, malware authors typically encrypt the payload to hide the malicious code from antimalware detection and remediation tools. In cybersecurity, a payload is malware that the threat actor intends to deliver to the victim. For example, if a cybercriminal sent out an email with a malicious Macro as the attachment and the victim gets infected with ransomware, then the ransomware is the payload. 

DOXING: It's the act of publicly revealing previously personal information about an individual or organization, usually via the Internet. Methods employed to acquire such info include searching publicly available databases & social media websites, hacking & social engineering. Doxing may be carried out for reasons such as onlie shaming, extortion(the practise of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats), & vigilante aid to law enforcement it also may be associated with hacktivism.

HACKTIVISM: In Internet activism, hacktivism is the use of CBT(Techniques) such as hacking as a form of civil disobedience(something like protests) to promote a political agenda or social change. Some of the common demands of this activism is for free speech, human rights, freedom of info movements & etcetera.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING: Social Engineering is the art of manipulatingpeople into performing actions or divulging confidential info, rather than by breaking or using technical cracking techniques. This term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of info gathering, fraud or computer system access, in most cases the attacker never comes face-face with the victim. Social enginnering used to gain info over the phone is known informally as blagging. In addition to criminal purposes, social engineerng has also been employed by debt collectors, skip tracers, private investigators, bounty hunters and tabloid journalists. A study found that upto 90% of all domains involved in distributing fake antivirus software used social engineering techniques.

MICROSOFT SECURITY BULLETIN: The detailed info about the newly patched security update by microsoft.

RPC(REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL): RPC is a powerful technique for constructing distributed, client-server based applications. It is based on extending the conventional local procedure calling so that the called procedure need not exist in the same address space as the calling procedure. The two processes may be on the same system, or they may be on different systems with a network connecting them. Remote Procedure Call is a software communication protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. RPC is used to call other processes on the remote systems like a local system. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call. RPC uses the client-server model. The requesting program is a client, and the service-providing program is the server. Like a local procedure call, an RPC is a synchronous operation requiring the requesting program to be suspended until the results of the remote procedure are returned. When program statements that use the RPC framework are compiled into an executable program, a stub is included in the compiled code that acts as the representative of the remote procedure code. When the program is run and the procedure call is issued, the stub receives the request and forwards it to a client runtime program in the local computer. The first time the client stub is invoked, it contacts a name server to determine the transport address where the server resides.
The client runtime program has the knowledge of how to address the remote computer and server application and sends the message across the network that requests the remote procedure. Similarly, the server includes a runtime program and stub that interface with the remote procedure itself. Response-request protocols are returned the same way. When a remote procedure call is invoked, the calling environment is suspended, the procedure parameters are transferred across the network to the environment where the procedure is to execute, and the procedure is then executed in that environment. When the procedure finishes, the results are transferred back to the calling environment, where execution resumes as if returning from a regular procedure call. RPC run-time system is a library of routines and a set of services that handle the network communications that underlie the RPC mechanism. In the course of an RPC call, client-side and server-side run-time systemsâ€™ code handle binding, establish communications over an appropriate protocol, pass call data between the client and server, and handle communications errors. 
During an RPC, the following steps take place:

*) The client calls the client stub. The call is a local procedure call with parameters pushed onto the stack in the normal way.

*) The client stub packs the procedure parameters into a message and makes a system call to send the message. The packing of the procedure parameters is called marshalling.

*) The client stub passes the message to the transport layer, which sends it to the remote server machine. 

*)  On the server, the transport layer passes the message to a server stub, which demarshalls(unpack) the parameters and calls the desired server routine using the regular procedure call mechanism. 

*) When the server procedure completes, it returns to the server stub (e.g., via a normal procedure call return), which marshalls the return values into a message. The server stub then hands the message to the transport layer. 

*) The transport layer sends the resulting message back to the client transport layer, which hands the message back to the client stub.

*) The client stub unmarshalls the return parameters, and execution returns to the caller.


MICROSOFT SECURITY BULLETIN MS08-067: This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Server service. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an affected system received a specially crafted RPC request. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Server service handles RPC requests. MS08-067 patched an issue in the netapi32.dll that could allow attack-
ers to use a specially crafted remote procedure call request via the Server
Message Block (SMB) service to take over a target system. This vulnerability
is particularly dangerous because it does not require an attacker to authen-
ticate to the target machine before running the attack. MS08-067 gained
eternal infamy as the vulnerability exploited by the Conficker worm, which
was widely reported in the media.
