Pentesting involves simulating real attacks to assess the risk associated with potential security breaches. On a pentest the testers not only discover vulnerabilities that could be useful by attackers but also exploit vulnerabilities, to asses what attackers might gain after a successful exploitation.

From time to time, a news story breaks about a major company being hit by a cyberattack. Usually, the attackers didn't use the latest & greatest zero-day. Major companies with fairly large security budgets fall victim to SQL Injection vulnerabilities on their websites, social-engineering attacks against employees, weak passwords on Internet-facing services, and so on. In other words, companies are losing proprietary data and exposing their clients’ personal details through security holes that could have been fixed. On a penetration test, the tester find these issues before an attacker does, and he recommends how to fix them and avoid future vulnerabilities.

*) What does a Penetester do?
A Pentester may also be tasked with assessing one or many custom web applications.He may perform social-engineering and client-side attacks to gain access to a client’s internal network. Some pentests will require the pentester to act like an insider—a malicious employee or attacker who has already breached the perimeter—as he perform an internal penetration test. Some clients will request an external penetration test, in which the pentester simulate an attack via the Internet. And some clients may want the pentester to assess the security of the wire-less networks in their office. In some cases, the pentester may even audit a client’s physical security controls.

*)STAGES OF THE PENTEST:-
(i) Pre-engagement phase: Talking to the client about their goals for the pentest, mapping out the scope (the extent and parameters of the test), and so on happens in this phase. When the pentester and the client agree about scope, reporting format, and other topics, the actual testing begins. Pentester performs pre-engagement interactions with the client to make sure everyone is on the same page about the pentest. Miscommunication between a pentester and a client who expects a simple vulnerability scan could lead to a sticky situation because penetration tests are much more intrusive. Ask questions about your client’s business. What matters most to them? For example, to a top online vendor, hours of downtime could mean thousands of dollars of lost revenue. To a local bank, having online banking sites go down for a few hours may annoy a few customers, but that downtime wouldn’t be nearly as devastating as the compromise of a credit card database. To an information security vendor, having their homepage plastered with rude messages from attackers could lead to a damaged reputation that snowballs into a major revenue loss.
Other important items to discuss and agree upon during the pre-engagement phase of the pentest include the following:
*)Scope:-What IP addresses or hosts are in scope, and what is not in scope? What sorts of actions will the client allow you to perform? Are you allowed to use exploits and potentially bring down a service, or should you limit the assessment to merely detecting possible vulnerabilities? Does the client
understand that even a simple port scan could bring down a server or router? Are you allowed to perform a social-engineering attack?

*)Testing Window:-The client may want you to perform tests only during specific hours or on certain days.

*)Contact information:-Whom should you contact if uou find something serious? Does the client expect you to contact someone 24hrs a day? Do they prefer that you use encryption for emails?

*)A "get out of jail free" card:- Make sure you have authorization to perform a penetration test on the target. If a target is not owned by the company (for instance, because it’s hosted by a third party), make sure to verify that the client has formal approval from the third party to perform the penetration test. Regardless, make sure your contract includes a statement that limits your liability in case something unexpected happens, and get written permission to perform the test.

*)Payment terms:- How & when will you be paid, and how much?
Finally, include a nondisclosure agreement clause in your contract.Clients will appreciate your written commitment to keep the penetration test and any findings confidential.

(ii) Information gathering phase (or) Reconnaissance: During this phase, you analyze freely available sources of information, a process known as gathering open source intelligence (OSINT).This phase provides the tester witha a wealth of information to identify vulnerabilities easily & exploit them later. It provides a sound foundation for the after happening pentesting. It's furtherly divided into 2 types:
(a) Passive Reconnaissance: Gathering info that's already available on the Internet. Most research is done using various websites, beginning with Google. The 1st step often involves using Google syntax,enumerating website subdomains, links and much more..
(b) Active Reconnaissance: The active reconnaissance directly probes the target system & retrieves output. Examples include fingerprinting the web-server using Nmap (or) Shodan Network Scanner, performing a DNS forward & reverse lookup in order to associate the newly discovered subdomains with their respective IP addresses, ping and even more advanced tools like Burp Suite can also be used, a DNS Zone transfer can be performed by using 'nslookup' command to identify the DNS Servers, after identifying the serers, the 'dig' command is used to attempt the DNS Zone Transfer and much more.. 

(iii) Threat modelling phase: In this phase the tester uses the info that he collected during the reconnaissance phase to determine the value of each finding(piece of info found during the reconnaissance phase) & impact to the client if the finding permitted an attacker to break int a system. This evaluation allows the pentester to develop an action plan & methods of attack. Here we think like attackers and develop plans of attack based on the information we’ve gathered.

(iv) Vulnerability analysis: Before a pentester can start attacking systems, he performs a vulnerability analysis. In this phase the tester attempts to discover vulnerabilities in the system that can be taken advantage of in further exploitation. Often during this phase, pentesters run vulnerability scanners, which use vulnerability databases and a series of active checks to make a best guess about which vulnerabilities are present on a client’s system. But though vulnerability scanners are powerful tools, they can’t fully replace critical thinking, so we also perform manual analysis and verify results on our own in this phase as well.

(v) Exploitation phase: A sucessful exploit is done in this phase.

(vi) Post-exploitaion phase: A sucessful exploit leads to this phase, where the result of the exploitation is leveraged to find additional info, sensitive data, access to other systems & so on. Some say pentests truly begin only after exploitation, in the post-exploitation phase. You got in, but what does that intrusion really mean to the client? If you broke into an unpatched legacy system that isn’t part of a domain or otherwise networked to high-value targets, and that system contains no information of interest to an attacker, that vulnerability’s risk is significantly
lower than if you were able to exploit a domain controller or a client's development system.

(viii) Reporting phase: The pentester summarizes the findings for both executives & technical practitioners. The final phase of penetration testing is reporting. This is where we convey our findings to the customer in a meaningful way. We tell them what they’re doing correctly, where they need to improve their security posture, how you got in, what you found, how to fix problems, and so on. Writing a good pentest report is an art that takes practice to master. You’ll need to convey your findings clearly to everyone from the IT staff charged with fixing vulnerabilities to upper management who signs off on the changes to external auditors.The pentest report should include both an executive summary and a technical report, as discussed in the following sections.
